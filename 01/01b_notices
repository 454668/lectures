+ Information
First homework is posted on GitHub, several of you have already started (or finished).
- Let me know how this goes.  Harder?  More onerous and tedious?
- Small edit on git submission: don't commit the full crime csv file.  

+ Discussion Session
First session tomorrow, Thursday, at 3-4:30 in room 224.
- If you are confused at all with the homework, or want to `go further.'
- Any residual installation or GitHub questions.
- We can also plan for Friday at 3pm, if this option is needed.

+ TAs Assigned!
Several of the MSCAPP students will be assisting with the course!
- Victor Vilchis Tella
- Devin Munger
- Leith McIndewar
You may already know them.  All super nice, and can help you out on Piazza or in person, at discussion times.
